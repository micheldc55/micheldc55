## Who I am...

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @micheldc55
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Deep Learning, Data Science, Big Data, Statistics and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu stats! But the thing I like the most is definitely Deep Learning!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on personal projects related to Text generation and Indexing and Image Similarity with Deep Learning, but work mostly on Data Science in my job.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michel-davidovich-ds/)

I'm passionate about Data Science. I'm currently working for a European airline company, my main work is in Dynamic Pricing by probabillistic modelling. But I've also worked in projects related to flight loads and in projects related to text generation and indexing through LLMs.

I used to work on Map Analytics for an European Map provider in Madrid, Spain. Unfortunately, that means that I cannot disclose exactly what I'm working on nor the company name, but we do a lot of analytics and ML models related to Map performance and user interactions. I'm also a Kaggle Expert, constantly trying to improve my DS skillset, so [check me out](https://www.kaggle.com/micheldc55) if you can! Feedback is appreaciated!

Before that I used to work in logistics and customer analytics for a company in my home country of Uruguay. We were in charge of building customer knowledge for the company. We developed clustering algorithms to better understand the similarities between customers at the e-commerce site. We also created models to improve order 

On my spare time, I like working on Deep Learning projects, mainly in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. I'm also building a Stats Database for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fans! Think of a place were you can reference if you need to know who are the biggest winners, the most submission oriented or the best trends of our sport. If you are interested in that, don't be afraid to let me know!
