I'm passionate about Data Science. I'm currently working on Map Analytics for an European Map provider in Madrid, Spain. Unfortunately, that means that I cannot disclose exactly what I'm working on nor the company name, but we do a lot of analytics and ML models related to Map performance and user interactions. I'm also a Kaggle Expert, constantly trying to improve my DS skillset, so [check me out](https://www.kaggle.com/micheldc55) if you can! Feedback is appreaciated!

Before that I used to work in logistics and customer analytics for a company in my home country of Uruguay. We were in charge of building customer knowledge for the company. We developed clustering algorithms to better understand the similarities between customers at the e-commerce site. We also created models to improve order 

On my spare time, I'm building a Stats Database for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fans! Think of a place were you can reference if you need to know who are the biggest winners, the most submission oriented or the best trends of our sport. If you are interested in that, don't be afraid to let me know!
