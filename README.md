I'm passionate about Data Science. I'm currently working on Map Analytics for an European Map provider in Madrid, Spain. Before that I used to work in logistics and customer analytics for a company in my home country of Uruguay. On my spare time, I'm building a Stats Database for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu fans! If you are interested in that, don't be afraid to let me know!
